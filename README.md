This game is pretty simple. Two player game. One player is Red, the other is Yellow. Take turns dropping the piece. First person to have the same pieces in 4 in a row either direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

Chose this game cause it's one of my favorites and you have to pay attention.
